# Pi Frame

A starter-kit for printing your own newspaper using a Raspberry Pi and e-ink display. Tested on a Raspberry Pi Zero W and Waveshare e-Paper HAT.

## Apps

### Included

Pi Frame comes with two basic apps to get started. Neither of these require any authentication or setup beyond package installation.

| Name                  | Description                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| [Hello World](TODO)   | Just prints 'Hello World' in a basic font |
| [Year Progress](TODO) | Show's how far through the year we are    |

### Elsewhere

These apps are the reason Pi Frame exists: I wanted an easy way to switch between apps at various parts of the day or week. They each require an internet connection plus various API key setup.

### Ideas

These are external projects that I think could be nice for Pi Frame.
