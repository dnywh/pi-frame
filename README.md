# Pi Press

A starter-kit for printing your own newspaper using a Raspberry Pi and e-ink display. Tested on a Raspberry Pi Zero W and Waveshare e-Paper HAT.

## Apps

### Included

Pi Press comes with two basic apps to get started. Neither of these require any authentication or setup beyond package installation.

Name | Description
|---|---|
|[Hello World](TODO) | Just prints 'Hello World' in a basic font.
|[Year Progress](TODO)| Show's how far through the year we are.

### Elsewhere

These apps are the reason Pi Press exists: I wanted an easy way to switch between them at various parts of the day or week. They each require an internet connection plus various API key setup.

Name | Description
|---|---|
|[Where ISS?](https://github.com/dnywh/where-iss) | Track what part of Earth the International Space Station is passing over
|[Surf Dot](https://github.com/dnywh/surf-dot) | Show the day's surf report in the style of K≈çhei Sugiura.
