# Pi Press

A starter-kit for printing your own newspaper using a Raspberry Pi and e-ink display.

This has been tested with a Raspberry Pi Zero W and Waveshare e-Paper HAT.

## Apps

Pi Press comes with two basic apps to get started. Neither of these require any authentication or setup beyond package installation.
